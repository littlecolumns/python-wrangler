    <p>Visit <a href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads">the Continuum website</a> to download the Anaconda installer. You want the <strong>64-bit version for Python 3</strong> (unless your computer is 32-bit, you really really need Python 2).</p>
    <p>If the installer asks if you want to install Anaconda just for you or for all users, pick <strong>just for you</strong>. This will make installing extra software easier in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> During installation, there's sometimes be a checkbox that says "Do you want to add Anaconda to the <code>PATH</code>?" If it shows up, <strong>be sure to check it</strong>. If you forget, though, we'll try to remind you!</p>
