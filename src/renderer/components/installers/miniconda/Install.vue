    <p>Visit <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">Continuum's Miniconda website</a> to download the Miniconda installer. You want the <strong>64-bit version for Python 3</strong> (unless your computer is 32-bit, you really really need Python 2).</p>
    <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> During installation, there's sometimes be a checkbox that says "Do you want to add Anaconda to the <code>PATH</code>?" If it shows up, <strong>be sure to check it</strong>.</p>
