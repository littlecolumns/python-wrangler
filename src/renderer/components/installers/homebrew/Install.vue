    <p>To install Homebrew, you'll need to use the Terminal, a text-only way of operating your computer that looks like a movie about hacking. To open Terminal, search for <strong>Terminal</strong> from Spotlight, or go to <strong>Applications > Utilities > Terminal</strong>.</p>
    <p>Then, visit <a href="https://brew.sh/">the Homebrew website</a> for installation instructions. It's just a little bit of cut-and-paste into Terminal and will only take a minute.</p>
    <p>Once Homebrew is installed, run the command <code>brew install readline xz</code> to install a couple pieces of software that Python might want later.</p>
    <p>Then you can install Homebrew's Python: run the command <code>brew install python3</code> to install Python 3. If you really need it, you can also install Python 2 with <code>brew install python2</code></p>
