    <p>Visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python.org downloads page</a> and install the version for your system. You'll want <strong>Python 3</strong> unless George Washington has specifically requested you time travel back to 1775 to work on some Python 2 code with him.</p>
    <p>The site is probably asking you to install 3.9.x. While there's certainly an argument to be made for using an older version (maybe some software isn't compatible with newer Pythons), the site makes older versions so hard to download! So: might as well download and install 3.9.</p>
    <div class="notification is-warning">
      <p>During installation there will be a checkbox that says something like "Add Python to environment variables" or "Do you want to add Python to the PATH?"</p>
      <p>By default, it is unchecked. <strong>When you see this option, click the checkbox next to it.</strong></p>
      <p>If you missed it the first time, just run the installer again and you'll have another chance.</p>
