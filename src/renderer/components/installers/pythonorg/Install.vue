    <p>Visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python.org downloads page</a> and install the version for your system. You'll want <strong>Python 3</strong> unless George Washington has specifically requested you time travel back to 1775 to work on some Python 2 code with him.</p>
    <p>The site is probably asking you to install 3.10.x. Sometimes the newest version is a little too advanced and has some issues running all the software we'll need, so it's usually a good idea to go back one version.</p>
    <p><strong>For example:</strong> if it's recommending 3.10.4, then we might want 3.10.3 instead. It can be <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3103/">downloaded here</a>).</p>
    <div class="notification is-warning">
      <p>During installation there will be a checkbox that says something like "Add Python to environment variables" or "Do you want to add Python to the PATH?"</p>
      <p>By default, it is unchecked. <strong>When you see this option, click the checkbox next to it.</strong></p>
      <p>If you missed it the first time, just run the installer again and you'll have another chance.</p>
