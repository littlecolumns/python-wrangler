    <p>Visit <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">the Python.org downloads page</a> and install the version for your system. You'll want <strong>Python 3</strong> unless George Washington has specifically requested you time travel back to 1775 to work on some Python 2 code with him.</p>
    <p>If it's asking you to install 3.9.0, ignore it - you'll probably want to install 3.8.6 instead. Download the <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-macosx10.9.pkg">OS X installer here</a> or <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.6/python-3.8.6-amd64.exe">Windows installer here</a> and you'll be good to go.</p>
    <div class="notification is-warning">
      <p>During installation there will be a checkbox that says something like "Add Python to environment variables" or "Do you want to add Python to the PATH?"</p>
      <p>By default, it is unchecked. <strong>When you see this option, click the checkbox next to it.</strong></p>
      <p>If you missed it the first time, just run the installer again and you'll have another chance.</p>
