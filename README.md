## Python Wrangler

Clean up all those Pythons crawling around your computer

**Python Wrangler** helps you install Python in a nice, pleasant, perfect way. Already installed it? Four times? Eighteen times? No problem, Python Wrangler can also help you **understand, organize, and remove** the Python installations hiding on your computer.

It’s **highly opinionated**, so you don’t need to think too hard: just do what Python Wrangler says and you’ll end up with a nice setup. Have opinions of your own? No worries, just use the data it gives you to clean up your system according to your own best practices.
